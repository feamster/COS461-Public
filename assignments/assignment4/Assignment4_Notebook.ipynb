Malicious hosts might not show up in lists of the top senders (either by bytes or by flows), and it can be difficult to determine the exact nature of attack traffic in advance. \n",

For example, many attackers attempt to detect hosts running vulnerable services by scanning the address space using TCP SYN packets.  If a NetFlow record indicates that a flow contained a TCP SYN packet _but no packets with the ACK flag set_, we can conclude that this flow never completed and thus may be part of a TCP SYN scan---particularly if there are a lot of these flows.\n",

In this case, the NetFlow record will contain both the TCP SYN and ACK flags in the flow record. These flows are difficult to distinguish from legitimate flows, because in this case a host actually answered the initial SYN. \n",
    "- There is no active host on the network at the destination IP address. In this case, we will only see TCP SYN flag. This is very different from the legitimate traffic behavior. It should be possible to identify malicious scanners by identifying these flows.\n",
    "- The destination is alive, but the port to which the SYN is sent is closed. If a client connects to a server's non-listening port, the server will send back a RST/ACK packet. According to normal TCP implementation guidelines, the scanner will immediately stop any TCP connection attempts once it receives a RST. Like in the previous case, the NetFlow record will show SYN requests from the scanner host to the destination host but no SYN/ACK packets in response."
